## Overview

For the Frontend Mentor QR code component challenge, I created a QR code component that allows users to generate QR codes for various purposes. The goal of this project was to practice building responsive and visually appealing components using HTML and CSS. I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly interface for generating QR codes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas:

  - **1. JavaScript Interactivity:** Adding dynamic features to the QR code component, such as the ability to customize QR code content and download generated QR codes.<br>

  - **2. Accessibility:** Ensuring that the component is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
<br>

  - **3. Cross-browser Compatibility:** Testing the component on various web browsers and ensuring it works seamlessly on different platforms.
